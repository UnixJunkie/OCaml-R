Todo:

-1- Close the interpreter when the application exits. As of now, things are dirty in this respect.

-2- Documentation is to be completed.

-3- Garbage collection to be done properly with OCaml / R.

-4- Try to make a way to execute R code that can mingle with Lwt. May need to reimplement the
    evaluation loop and to use hidden symbols of libR.so.
