(*XXX n-ary methods

how to express optional fields?  if they are there, they must have
some type, but  they do not have to be there

use variant types instead of object types?
   in a negative position...  (but then we have to negate again...)

    { foo: "bar", baz : 7 } : [`foo of string field | `baz of int field] obj

    let f (x : t) = (x : [< `foo of string field | `baz of int field| `x of string field] obj)
