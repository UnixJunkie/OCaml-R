module type Environment = sig
(**  [Environment] is the type of a module containing all necessary
  *  informations and data in order to set up the R interpreter
  *  properly.
  *
  *  We still have to find a mechanism to strip down the R packages
  *  loaded at startup. *)

  val name : string
  (**  This is the [name] of the first argument of [argv] for R.
    *  Mandatory, otherwise [libR.so] segfaults immediately. *)

  val options : string list
  (**  Other command line options passed to the [libR.so] library when
    *  initialising R.
    *
    *  @see "R reference manual" File refman.pdf, page 452, section intitled
    *  'Startup - Initialization at Start of an R Session' for details
    *  about the most important command line options.
    *  @see <http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html#Invoking-R>
    *  For command line options.
    *)

  val signal_handlers : bool
  (**  If set to [false], asks R not to install its signal handlers. I've
    *  been experiencing weird issues with R signal handlers, since, for
    *  instance, a [SIGSEGV] is sometimes caught by [libR.so], and R asks then
    *  asks whether or not you want to save your workspace, et ceter√¶... By
    *  default, set to false.
    *)

  val env : (string * string) list
  (**  These are environment variables that needs to be set before
    *  initialising the R interpreter. In the [Standard] module, these
    *  values are determined when the binding itself is compiled.
    *)

  val packages : string list option
  (**  Packages loaded on startup. If set to [None], load the usual standard
    *  library. Otherwise, if set to [Some p], load packages [p] in place of
    *  the standard library. In the [Standard] module, this is set to [Some []]. *)
