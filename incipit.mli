(**  This is the R module of the OCaml-R package. It encapsulates the
  *  functionalities of the libR.so shared library provided by the R
  *  software. This enables us to embed the R interpreter into Objective
  *  Caml, to execute R code from Objective Caml and to exchange data
  *  structures between R and Objective Caml.
